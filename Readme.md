# RetroMOO

[RetroMOO](https://retromoo.onrender.com/) is a learning and passion project inspired by the [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon) and [MOOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO) of the 90s, aiming to emulate the gameplay and design of the genre without the learning curve associated with a telnet client and a dated UI. RetroMOO is still very much a WIP, but development is ongoing.
